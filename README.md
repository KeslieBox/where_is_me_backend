-```cd``` into the directory (I recommend setting up a folder to house both the front and backend and clone both repositories there)

-run ```explorer.exe index.html to get the browser running (note this may be a different command for Mac and sometimes even for Windows users)

-after cloning the frontend to your computer, set up the backend as instructed below:

### Backend Setup

-Fork and clone this repository & run ```git clone <github-repo-code>``` from your terminal

-run ```bin/rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development```

-run ```bundle install```

-run ```rails s``` in the terminal to start your server

-Finally go to <http://localhost:3000/> in your browser

From here, you can begin using the application and playing around with the database, adding herbs to it, editing what is there to your liking, etc!
